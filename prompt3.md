1. When I click on the circles for example in "淨零排放或碳中和承諾狀態", the html changes the selection. Manual choosing selection shouldn't allowed but should be static based on data.
2. At least one option should be chosen. RE100 should be "未加入" for this particular example.
3. The labels for "溫室氣體涵蓋類型" are inside the circle but should be under the circle, similar to other data like "範疇二排放". The circles size for "溫室氣體涵蓋類型" seem a little smaller too.
4. The UI for "政府用電大戶再生能源義務ⓘ" has the same problem as "溫室氣體涵蓋類型" (smaller circle, misplaced lables).
5. Move "低碳經濟轉型產品/服務" and "低碳產品營收占比" to "策略與行動". Place after 減量基準年。
6. Remove the "績效指標" section。
7. Show actual line graphs for data in 氣候績效趨勢, not just numbers.
8. Adopt a two columns approach for our dashboard section (after summary section)
